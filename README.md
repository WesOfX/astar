Defines a `path` method for efficiently finding the shortest path between two `node`'s on a weighted graph. A `node` contains a `vector` of `edge`'s. An `edge` is a `node*` `cost_type` `pair`. The `node*` represents a connected `node` and the `cost_type` value represents the cost of moving to that `node`. `cost_type` is a templated type. Either integer or floating-point types can be used for `cost_type`. `node`'s also have a `tentative` cost and a `heuristic` cost. By default, the `tentative` cost is set to `max` and the `heuristic cost` is set to `0`. To get the true cost of getting to one `node` from another, the `path` method can be used. The `path` method takes two `node`'s as references (`start` and `goal`) and returns the `cost` of the path. If the `cost` is `max` then a path does not exist. If a path was found, all of the `node`'s along the shortest path will have `tentative` values which are the true cost of reaching the `node`. To retrace a path, start at the `goal` node and follow the `node`'s with the lowest `tentative` values until you inevitably reach the `start` `node`.
