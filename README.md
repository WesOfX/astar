tA c++ implementation of the A\* search algorithm using a priority queue and a templated weight-type. The algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes on a weighted graph.

A `node` uses a templated `cost_type` and contains a `vector` of `edge`s and two `cost_type` values: `tentative` and `heuristic`. An `edge` is a pair of `node*` and `cost_type`. The `path` method takes two `node&` and returns a `cost_type` of the sum of the weighs of all of the `edge`s along the shortest possible path between the two `node`s. In addition, the `path` method sets the `tentative` values of all of the `node`s along the path to the sum of the weights of all the `edge`s along the shortest possible path from the `start` `node` to that `node` alowing you to retrace the shortest path by starting at the `goal` `node` and following the `node`s with the smallest `tentative` values until you reach the `start` node.
